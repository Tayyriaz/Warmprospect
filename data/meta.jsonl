FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS What is GoAccel? GoAccel is an all-in-one growth and operations system built specifically for home services and skilled trade businesses. It combines customer acquisition, automation, CRM, scheduling, and operational systems into a single platform designed to help owners scale predictably and build long-term enterprise value – not just get more leads. How is GoAccel different from HubSpot, GoHighLevel, or Jobber? Most platforms solve one part of the business. GoAccel solves the whole system. CRMs manage contacts. Marketing tools generate leads. Field service tools handle jobs. GoAccel connects all of it – marketing, follow-up, operations, reporting, and automation – into a unified operating system designed for growth and eventual exit . Who is GoAccel built for? GoAccel is built for owners of home services and trade businesses with growth ambitions. If you’re running a home services or skilled trade operation and want predictable leads, cleaner operations, fewer bottlenecks, and a business that doesn’t rely entirely on you, GoAccel is designed for that stage of ownership. Is GoAccel just software, or is there guidance too? GoAccel is both the platform and the growth playbook. In addition to software, GoAccel provides proven digital agency services, templates, automations, and best practices – so you’re not guessing what to build. The goal is execution with clarity, not trial and error. How does GoAccel help increase the value of my business? By systemizing what buyers look for.
